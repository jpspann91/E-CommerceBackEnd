## Description
This is the backend portion of an E-Commerce Site. We used Express.js for the server and MySQL for the database in combination with Sequelize as our ORM to run SQL models and routes. The database includes tables for tags, categories, products, and product tags. Routes were created to make requests and updates with the database which are establised through sequelize queries.

Enter password and set source with `source db/schema.sql`. The type `exit to leave MySQL. Seed the database with `npm run seed`. Then start the server with `npm run start`.

## Usage
This app is used to showcase the use of Node, Express, MySQL, Sequelize and Dotenv all in one project. Establishes routes so we can hit different end points of our database.
